## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- **Command Line Navigation**: Used `cd` to change directories and understood the importance of correct paths.
- **Git Basics**:
  - `git clone` to download a repo.
  - `git add .` to stage changes.
  - `git commit -m` to snapshot work.
  - `git push` to send it to GitHub.
- **Troubleshooting**: Fixed an identity error using:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Jonathan McGurgan"
  git config --global user.email "jonmcgurgan@gmail.com"
  ```
- **Authentication**: Signed into GitHub using the Git Credential Manager popup.

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

- Ensure every future lab is saved in a **clearly named subfolder** (e.g., `Git-Basics`, `Network-Scanning`, `Password-Cracking`).
- Continue writing reflections like this to demonstrate learning and build a reference you can revisit anytime.
